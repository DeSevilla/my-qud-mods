This is a mod for Caves of Qud that makes statues animatable by all standard means (Spray-a-Brain, nano-neuro animators).
Dynamic statues of creatures have the anatomy of their creature type, while predefined statues have the best anatomy I
can assign based on their appearances and descriptions. The easiest way to install it is from [the Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2918604974).

Known limitations:

* There's no way to track mutations on statues, so they won't show up on animated statues even if logically they'd be part of it (e.g. multiple arms, chimera limbs, wings).
* Since sultan shrines and Eater statues have both humanoid and non-humanoid variants that are identical except for their render tiles, they're always humanoid when animated, since there's no clean way to set the anatomies differently.
* I believe (but haven't tested) that statues' bodies are considered organic rather than whatever material the statue was made out of. For predefined statues, fixing this would require adding new anatomies, and there's no clean way to do it for dynamic statues.

This mod is *probably* compatible with any mod which doesn't change statues or how animating objects works. But it involves a rather fiddly Harmony patch, so no guarantees.
