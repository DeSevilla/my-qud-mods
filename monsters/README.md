Terrors of the Depths is a mod that adds some dangerous new creatures to the deep caves of Qud. They are:

1. The blightcrawler, a mechanical worm which tunnels through the earth and spews noxious miasma.
2. The primordial jell, an ooze similar to other jells whose base liquid is primordial soup.
3. The prophet of the Sightless Way, a psychic similar to the Sightless Way's dervishes 
    but stronger, who will preach lines of possibly-nonsense visions.
4. The girsh kraken, a slow but dangerous monstrosity which spews out lesser girsh creatures from its innards
5. The thing in the dark.
