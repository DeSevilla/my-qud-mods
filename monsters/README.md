Terrors of the Depths is a mod that adds some dangerous new creatures to the deep caves of Qud. They are:

1. The blightcrawler, a mechanical worm which tunnels through the earth and spews noxious miasma.
    Spawns uncommonly in tiers 5 and 6.
2. The primordial jell, an ooze similar to other jells whose base liquid is primordial soup. Spawns in tier 6 and commonly in tier 7.
3. The prophet of the Sightless Way, a psychic similar to the Sightless Way's dervishes 
    but stronger, who will preach lines of possibly-nonsense visions. Spawns commonly in tier 8 only.
4. The girsh kraken, a slow but dangerous monstrosity which spews out lesser girsh creatures from its innards. Spawns rarely in tiers 7 and 8.
5. The thing in the dark. Spawns in tier 8 and rarely tier 7.
